This document describes a number of experiments that explore the behaviour of the Guyton model \cite{Guyton1972} under a range of physiological conditions. These experiments were provided by Ronald J. White, who has extended the original model to research the physiological consequences of weightlessness in manned space flight \cite{White2003,White1998,White1982,White1991}.
