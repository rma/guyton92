This directory contains experiments that explore the behaviour of the Guyton
model under a range of physiological conditions. These experiments were
provided by Ronald J. White, who also provided the original Fortran code for
the Guyton model.

The experiments are defined in the following files:

  hypertension.exp
  nephrosis.exp
  exercise.exp
  fistula.exp

To run one of these experiments, give the name of the experiment file as an
argument to the model binary. For example:

  ./build/guyton92 ./exps/hypertension.exp

Each experiment is described in the accompanying documentation:

  doc/experiments.pdf
